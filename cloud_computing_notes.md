## What is Cloud Computing?

1. A model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing:
    Network
    Servers
    Storage
    Applications
    Services
2. Can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort
3. Provides high levels of abstractions from computation to Storage
4. Basically hard drives, databases or CPUs served to us on demand.
5. Has some essential characteristics, service models and deployment models.

## Essential characteristics of Cloud Computing:

1. On-demand self-service
2. Heterogenous access(available anytime from anywhere)
3. Resource Pooling
4. Measured access
5. High availability at all times

## Why we need cloud Computing?
1. Flexibility (can be easily scaled up and down and also pay per use)
2. Disaster-Recovery
3. Automatic software updates
4. No Large Up-front investment
5. Increased Collaboration
6. Working from anywhere
7. Document Control
8. Security
9. Competitiveness
10. Environment friendly

## Service Models in the Cloud 
1. Software as a Service(SaaS)
    Provides consumer the capability to use the provider's application running on a cloud infrastructure.
    Applications are accessible from various client devices such as web browser, a mobile phone or tablet
    Examples: Webmail, skype, facetime or whatsapp , Office365 etc.
    Consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure.

2. Platform as a Service(PaaS)
    Provides the consumer the capability to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer created or acquired applications developed using 
    programming languages and tools supported by the provider.
    Consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure.
    Consumer has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.
    Example: Cloud Foundry, Microsoft Azure and Google cloud

3. Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)
